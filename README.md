# NFL-games-rest-days
The goal of this paper was to determine if the number of rest days was influential on whether an NFL team won or lost a game. In addition, the model is also useful for understanding which National Football League (NFL) game events are statistically significant and to what magnitude they increase or decrease the odds of winning. A logistic regression was used to understand the effects of these game events on the outcome of the game. It was found that fourth down completions, defensive touchdowns, and being the Patriots increase the odds of winning the most. Total number of fourth downs, interceptions, and fumbles increase the odds of losing the most.
